# Credit Card Application Approval Model (PySpark)
Building a Credit Card Application Acceptance Model

The bank is looking to build a credit card application acceptance model. Normally, banks use credit bureau scores to decide on credit card applications. Since this market doesn’t have a credit bureau score for the majority of customers, the task to build the application acceptance model becomes tricky. Since this bank already has some presence in the credit card space in the region, the data available to build the model is application data and the performance of these customers.
